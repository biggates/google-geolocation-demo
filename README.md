google-geolocation-demo
=======================

This is a demo of Google Maps Geolocation API.

This project uses Google Geolocation and Maps API to:
- Determine the location using cell id
- Draw the accuracy circle on Google map
- Display some information in the popup window

Although all the calls can be made through pure JavaScript,
a php script is contained in this demo to handle 
the POST request to Google Geolocation API.
